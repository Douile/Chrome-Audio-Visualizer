- Thanks for helping out!

**NOTICE**: This extension has been removed from the chrome webstore for violating the [spam policy](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/program_policies#spam), as I do not agree with this classification I have resubmitted for re-approval. While the extension is not on the store you can install using the unpacked version after downloading the repository, or using the webstore signed [1.24 version](https://github.com/Douile/Chrome-Audio-Visualizer/releases/download/v1.26/chrome-audio-visualizer-v1.24.crx) or the self signed [1.26 version](https://github.com/Douile/Chrome-Audio-Visualizer/releases/download/v1.26/chrome-audio-visualizer-v1.26.crx) (To install you must drag the downloaded .crx file into your [chrome extensions tab](chrome://extensions) (chrome://extensions)). _The self signed version will give a warning that it has not been downloaded from the chrome store and may be unusable_.

[Enjoy music visualizations? Check out my plane9 custom playlist](https://gist.github.com/Douile/640bc92c624090ea0f7758a021bfbd71), I hope one day chrome audio visualizer can look this good.
